# typing_tutor_react

### Description:
On my technology journey I have been severely held back by my typing speed, accuracy, and consistency. I made a concious effort to improve my skills and began reguraly using sites like speedcoder.net and typeracer.com. Since I started practicing I have more than doubled my typing speed and improved my accuracy. This project pays homage to the old disk typing games and is a way for me to improve my dev skills while creating a space for other devs to practice their typing.

### Live Demo:
_**Coming SOON!**_

### How to Use:
From the home page select " Begin Session"
This will load a new page with a text box of randomlt generated text.
The cursor will be blinking over the first character in the text and you will be prompted to begin typing.
Once you begin typing the timer will start and your mistakes and speed will be tracked dynamically.
If you type the correct charcter the cursor will shift to the next character in the text until complete.
If you type the incorrect charcter the cursor will not move and the mistkaes counter will be incremented by +1.
